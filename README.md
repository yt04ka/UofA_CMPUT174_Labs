    What to do:
    1. Read data from klingon-english.txt
    2. Ask the user to choose a Klingon consonant they want to practice with. 
    Ask again if the user’s answer is not a valid Klingon consonant, until the user enters a valid consonant.
    3. Find a Klingon word that starts with the chosen consonant 
    (the text file contains only one word that starts with any given consonant, so you don’t need to use the random library)
    4. Ask the user to translate the chosen word into Klingon
    5. Print Correct if the user’s answer is correct
    6. Print Sorry, you’re wrong! if the user’s answer is wrong
    7. If the answer is incorrect, show the first hint: the first and last characters 
    of the correct Klingon word. When showing a hint, replace all other characters with a star (*)
    8. If the answer is still incorrect, show the second hint: 
    the first and the last characters plus an extra random character of the correct Klingon word.
    9. Print The correct answer is ... if all three user’s answers are wrong
