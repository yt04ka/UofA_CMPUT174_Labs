    What to do:
    1. Ask the user for a name and age of a character.
    2. Print out a message displaying the character's age and 
    listing the characters who are older than the given character (print nothing if there are none)
    3. Print out a message displaying the character's age and 
    listing the characters who are younger than the given character (print nothing if there are none)
    
    If the entered age is negative, print "Invalid age."

    (There are hardcoded names and age of 8 persons, all the comparisons of our character are made with this list)
    We may not use dictionaries
